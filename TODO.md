# TODO

- [x] Parse prereqs more accurately (e.g. look at CMSC412)
- [ ] Display the set of courses one must choose only one from (or display multiple graphs as multiple options/paths to the desired course). Use the `pickOneFromEach` object in the `prereqs` object.
- [ ] Handle and distinguish between failed requests, no prerequisites, and errors
- [ ] Consider corequisites
- [ ] Mention restrictions
- [x] Handle direct visits to links to the website where a course is appended to the link (e.g. handle a direct visit to https://umd-course-vis.surge.sh/CMSC330)
- [ ] Add 200 and 400 page
- [ ] Add paths to icons in `public/manifest.json`
- [ ] Remove the submit button, render results after user stops typing
